    /**
     Verifies a query, also showing query results on failure.

     For this verifier, a "query" is an intermediate result which will be transformed into an eventual result. There are two types:

     a) Any slow or expensive operation that you don't want in fast-running unit tests is a "query." A network request is a common example: it will go out, and after some time a response will come back.

     b) A set of commands to generate a complex result is also a "query." Drawing an image is an example: the image rendering code will perform some given commands, producing an image.

     In either case, a change in the query may or may not be desirable, but you need to see the eventual result to decide. This verifier shows the query difference, but also shows the result. This gives you a chance to examine the result so that you can decide whether to approve the new query.

     Extend your object to conform to `ExecutableQuery` from within your test code. Then `verifyQuery` will use a special reporter that verifies the query expressed as a string by `getQuery()`. If the query has changed, then the result is produced by calling `executeQuery(_:)`.
