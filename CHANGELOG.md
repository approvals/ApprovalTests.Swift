**Features:**

- Skip reporters that can't handle the file type.
- `verifyAll`:  Now has versions with a labeler closure to format each line, along with a header.
- `verifyAll` : Any `label` is no longer optional. If you omitted it previously, add `label: ""`. Though this may mean a change to test code, the approved artifacts won't change.
